# LifeLedger

We propose a unified health ledger which helps store their medical history and all sensitive medical data on a decentralized peer to peer network(IPFS) and can be accessed only through metadata stored on blockchain with the permission of the patient. We  introduce a website for our product. 

## Use of blockchain
Data breaches: Data stored on a blockchain is immutable, meaning once recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This feature prevents unauthorized tampering with patient record Permissioned Access: Blockchain networks can implement permissioned access controls, where only authorized parties are granted access to sensitive patient information. 
Consolidation: Blockchain-based health ledgers facilitate secure and efficient sharing of health data between hospital chains while ensuring patient privacy and consent.
During emergency situations, doctors can quickly access a patient's comprehensive medical history, including past diagnoses, treatments, allergies, and medications. The unified health ledger ensures that patient records are up-to-date, accurate, and complete
Immutability ensures that data , pnce uploaded cannot be manipulated by any unauthorized individual or entity.
